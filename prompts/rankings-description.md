When a user navigates to the ranking screen, they will be presented with three lists for the three rankings.  Users can use drag and drop
to re-arrange the rankings within a list.

For TeamMembers the list must not contain their own team and any other teams that the TeamMember's team is excluded from ranking.

There should be a Save button to save their rankings.

If a user logs back in, the team rankings should be shown as previously saved by the user.
